Read the following for a better understanding on how to generate a release of
EZWebGallery.

* Two scripts are provided :
    0 - Linux only : set the execute permission of the two sh script files on.
    1 - compress_javascript will compress the javascript files using
        YUI_COMPRESSOR. The "web files" are nows ready to be included in a
        release using the 2nd script.
    2 - create_release builds the proper file structure into the target
        directory and copies to it the required files. Including the compressed
        js files generated using the 1st script.

IMPORTANT NOTE: in order to run EZWebGallery, the directories "res" and "skins"
have to be placed in the binary folder. Thus, YOU HAVE TO manually copy them
before testing your builds.

The workflow would then be :
1 - Build the release binary
2 - Run "compress_javascript"
3 - Run "create_release"
4 - You can now properly run a release of EZWebGallery.
5 - If you want to debug EZWebGallery, build the debug binary then copy the
    folders "res" and "skin" in its folder.
