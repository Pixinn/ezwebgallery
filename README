Read the following for a better understanding on how to generate a release of
EZWebGallery.

UBUNTU or DEBIAN:

    run "sudo qmake-qt4 && make install".
    
    You can build a function debug ezwebgallery after the first proper installation.

WINDOWS

    1 - "compress_javascript" will compress the javascript files using
        YUI_COMPRESSOR. The "web files" are nows ready to be included in a
        release using the 2nd script. If you are using Ubuntu, YUI_COMPRESSOR
        can be downloaded in the package "yui-compressor".
    2 - "create_release" builds the proper file structure into the target
        directory and copies the required files, Including the compressed
        js files generated using the 1st script.

    IMPORTANT NOTE (Windows only):
    ---------------
    In order to run EZWebGallery, the directories "res" and "skins"
    have to be placed alongside the binary. Thus, if you want to debug a binary,
    YOU HAVE TO manually copy them into the debug directory.
