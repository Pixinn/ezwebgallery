Read the following for a better understanding on how to generate a release of
EZWebGallery.

* On Linux you can run "make install": EZWebGallery will then be installed in
  /opt/ezwebgallery.
  If you are running windows or want to perform a manual installation, follow
  these instructions:

    0 - Linux only : set the execute permission of the two sh script files on.
    1 - "compress_javascript" will compress the javascript files using
        YUI_COMPRESSOR. The "web files" are nows ready to be included in a
        release using the 2nd script. If you are using Ubuntu, YUI_COMPRESSOR
        can be downloaded in the package "yui-compressor".
    2 - "create_release" builds the proper file structure into the target
        directory and copies the required files, Including the compressed
        js files generated using the 1st script.
    3 - Linux only: "deploy" builds the release binary then run the two previous 
        scripts, thus building from scratch a folder containing all the files
        needed to deploy EZWebGallery.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
---------------
In order to run EZWebGallery, the directories "res" and "skins"
have to be placed alongside the binary. Thus, if you want to debug a binary,
YOU HAVE TO manually copy them into the debug directory.
